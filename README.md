## Data Preparation and Cleaning

Data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting errors and inconsistencies in data. It is an important step in the data preparation process, as faulty or inaccurate data can lead to incorrect results or invalid conclusions.

Required Libraries
pandas
numpy
Steps for Data Cleaning
Import necessary libraries and read in the data as a pandas DataFrame.
Check for missing or null values and handle them appropriately. This may involve dropping rows or columns with a high percentage of missing values, or imputing values for missing entries.
Check for and handle incorrect data types. It may be necessary to convert columns to the appropriate data type in order to perform certain operations or analyses.
Check for and handle outliers. This may involve removing or transforming extreme values that may be incorrect or significantly affect your results.
Check for and handle duplicate data. This may involve dropping duplicate rows or merging duplicates together.
Save the cleaned DataFrame to a new file or overwrite the original file.
